** Advent of code 2020 solutions 

no real reason to commit these. 
All the code here computes the solutions to part 2 of the questions, because I couldent be bothered to commit the part 1's seperatly 

I also didnt try to spend time trying to find the optimal solution to the probelms, just tried to solve them with the tools i had. 
e.g crt for 13 part 2.
